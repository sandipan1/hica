# Highly customizable Agent Library (HICA)

Move beyond agent frameworks to build production-ready AI systems.
HICA gives you complete control over your AI agents' prompts, context windows, tool execution, and control flow. Stop trading convenience for reliability—build agents that work in production.

## 🎯 Why HICA?

Most agent frameworks are black boxes that work great for demos but fail in production. You can't debug decisions, modify prompts, or handle edge cases when you don't control the fundamentals.

HICA is built on four core principles:

- **🎛️ Control Your Prompts** - Own every instruction your agent receives
- **🪟 Manage Context Windows** - Engineer context for maximum efficiency and reliability  
- **🔧 Simplify Tools & Workflows** - Everything is a structured tool call that includes MCP 
- **🎮 Own Control Flow** - Build custom execution patterns that fit your use case
- ** Observability & tool** - Build you are own observability flow by integrating with existing OpenTelemetry workflows or building your own
