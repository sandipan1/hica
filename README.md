# Highly customizable Agent Library (HICA)

Move beyond agent frameworks to build production-ready AI systems.
HICA gives you complete control over your AI agents' Thought , Action and Observation. This simplicity in-practice looks like a having complete control over prompts, context windows, tool execution, and control flow. Many existing libraries trade convenience over control for reliabilityâ€”build agents that work in production.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why HICA?

Most agent frameworks are black boxes that work great for demos but fail in production or lock you in with certain vendors. You can't debug decisions, modify prompts, or handle edge cases , change your stack at will when you don't control the fundamentals.

HICA is built on four core principles:

- **Control Your Prompts** - Own every instruction your agent receives
- **Manage Context Windows** - Engineer context for maximum efficiency and reliability  
- **Simplify Tools & Workflows** - Everything is a structured tool call that includes MCP 
- **Own Control Flow** - Build custom execution patterns that fit your use case
- **Observability & tool** - Build you are own observability flow by integrating with existing OpenTelemetry workflows or building your own

## Agentic Workflow
Agents work in a continuous cycle of:Â thinking (Thought) â†’ acting (Act) and observing (Observe).

**Thought**: The LLM part of the Agent decides what the next step should be.
**Action**: The agent takes an action, by calling the tools with the associated arguments.
**Observation**: The model reflects on the response from the tool.

These three components Thought-Action-Observation work in a continuous loop. When we are building an Agent , it might fail in one of these 3 steps .
As long as we control each component of this loop , we can build Agents systematically and reliably.
